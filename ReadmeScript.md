script.js Understanding
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The functions used in the provided script can be categorized into Express and PostgreSQL functionalities. Here is the breakdown:

Express Functions:
1. POST request to add a new user - Handles the form submission and sends a POST request to the server to add a new user.
2. GET request to fetch users - Fetches the list of users from the server using a GET request.
3. PUT request to update a user - Handles the form submission for editing a user and sends a PUT request to update the user data.
4. DELETE request to delete a user - Handles the deletion of a user and sends a DELETE request to the server.

PostgreSQL Functions:
1. Checking if email exists - Checks if the entered email already exists in the user list.
2. Checking if phone number exists - Checks if the entered phone number already exists in the user list.

User Interface (UI) Functions:
1. Opening and closing the Edit User Modal - Handles the visibility of the modal for editing a user.
2. Opening and closing the Delete User Modal - Handles the visibility of the modal for confirming user deletion.
3. Handling the edit form submission - Handles the form submission for editing a user.

Server Interaction Functions:
1. Fetching users - Fetches the user data from the server and populates the table.
2. Confirming and deleting a user - Sends a DELETE request to the server to delete a user.

User Interaction Functions:
1. Editing a user - Opens the Edit User Modal with pre-filled data for a specific user.
2. Filtering the user list based on search query - Filters the user list based on the entered search query.

The UI functions are responsible for managing the visibility and interaction with the modal windows. The Server Interaction functions handle the communication with the server for fetching user data and deleting a user. The User Interaction functions handle user-triggered actions like editing a user and filtering the user list based on search queries.

Note: These categorizations are based on the provided function names and their respective purposes.

These functions collectively handle the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the user data using Express and PostgreSQL.

Note: Some functions may be dependent on others, and the implementation of the server-side code is assumed to handle the corresponding routes and database operations.

server.js
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's the categorization for the provided code:

Express Server Configuration:
- Setting up the Express server and defining the port.
- Configuring the connection to the ElephantSQL database using pg.Pool.

Server Routes:
1. Add a new user - Handles the HTTP POST request for adding a new user to the database.
2. Update a user - Handles the HTTP PUT request for updating an existing user in the database.
3. Delete a user - Handles the HTTP DELETE request for deleting a user from the database.
4. Get all users - Handles the HTTP GET request for fetching all users from the database.
5. Serve the index.html file - Handles the HTTP GET request for serving the index.html file.

Server Middleware:
- Parses the JSON request bodies using `express.json()` middleware.
- Serves static files from the 'public' directory using `express.static()` middleware.

Server Initialization:
- Starts the server and listens on the specified port.

Categorizing the code helps in understanding the different components and functionalities of the Express server, such as server configuration, handling routes, using middleware, and server initialization.
